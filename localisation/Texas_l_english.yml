 tex.5.t:0 "The Republic Texas Proposes a Deal"
 tex.5.d:0 "A diplomat from The Republic of Texas has proposed a deal from their government. They've offered 4 civilian factories in return for the Eastern part of our country. While it is nothing but desert, it also contains most of our largest cities and population. The option weighs heavily on us, but we fear what the Texas will do if we decline their offer. We also have a threat to our West; California. Texas has also offered a guarantee of independence if we accept their offer."
 tex.5.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 tex.5.b:0 "We would never give away our vitality."
 tex.6.t:0 "New Mexico has Declined"
 tex.6.d:0 "Despite our generous offer of support, the officials of New Mexico have declined our offer. We've tried to be gracious in our offer, but they still refuse to accept. While we did pledge to keep democracy pure, we will still make an excursion into Eastern New Mexico. They will not be able to defend, but they might attempt to. The occupation of Eastern New Mexico may be costly, but it's resources are worth the risk. We could always abort the border restoration, but if not, we need to do this."
 tex.6.a:0 "We should cancel the restoration"
 tex.6.b:0 "Occupy Eastern New Mexico"
 tex.7.t:0 "The Republic of Texas Offers Protection"
 tex.7.d:0 "Earlier today, we have recieved a diplomatic proposition from the Republic of Texas. They offer support in return for Northwest Colorado and Southeast Colorado. With our country split in two, they've offered military access. On top of that, they offer protection from California and Utah. The last thing they offer is 3 civilian factories. It would be hard to say no, but it may be necessary. If anything, it would be a blessing to get rid of the Rocky Mountains."
 tex.7.a:0 "Who would say no?"
 tex.7.b:0 "A generous offer, but no."
 tex.8.t:0 "Colorado has Declined"
 tex.8.d:0 "Although our offer was exceedingly generous, the government officials in Colorado have still said no. We have tried our best, but we've gone too far to be stopped now. The only option we have is force, which won't fair well for the democratic ideology. Nevertheless, we must make an incursion into central Colorado. The right to our former lands cannot be impeded. We must act quickly."
 tex.8.a:0 "Commence the attack."
 tex.9.t:0 "The Republic of Texas Offers Aid for the Panhandle"
 tex.9.d:0 "The government officials in the Republic of Texas have offered their support in return for the Oklahoma panhandle. In return for admittance into the United States, the Texans had to lose a lot of land. Now that the United States is no more, the Texans seek to reclaim it. The giant to our south already has a distain for the Oklahomans, so we should do our best to appease them. Their offer of civilian factories is the best that we can expect from them."
 tex.9.a:0 "We should appease them."
 tex.9.b:0 "It may have been theirs, but not anymore."
 tex.10.t:0 "The Oklahomans have said no"
 tex.10.d:0 "Despite our overwhelming power and our generous offer, the Oklahoman government has still denied our request. There is no way that they could have not seen the risks of the denial. We over power them significantly, and if they think that we will put up with the indignance shown by their government and people. We do not seek to remove them from the map, but we will only attempt to forcefully persuede them into giving us what we want."
 tex.10.a:0 "Begin the attack"
 tex.11.t:0 "Texas Demands Southeast Wyoming"
 tex.11.d:0 "Despite all of their territorial gains recently, the Repubic of Texas still hungers for their previous territory. They demand little from us, just Southeast Wyoming. If the Texans don't get what they want, we'll suffer the same fate as all of the other states that have denied them. While it's a small piece of land in the south, and it's only desert, it is representitive of our military strength. If we submit without a fight, we will be percieved as weak and we will be taken advantage of. We cannot allow that to happen."
 tex.11.a:0 "It's only desert anyway"
 tex.11.b:0 "We'll never give it up!"
 tex.12.t:0 "Wyoming has Refused!"
 tex.12.d:0 "Despite our overwhelming military strength, the government of Wyoming has denied us from occupying Southeast Wyoming. Although it's just desert, they seem to want to make a statement. Their economy is dirt compared to ours and they cannot withstand an attack. We should prepare to advance into Southeast Wyoming and occupy it permanently."
 tex.12.a:0 "Commence the attack"
 tex.13.t:0 "We are Victorious in Wyoming!"
 tex.13.d:0 "Following battles in Southern Wyoming, the Texan forces have overwhelmed the Wyomingite troops and maintained control of Southeastern Wyoming. The Wyoming forces surrendered before too much damage was done and we've maintained control of Southeastern Wyoming and they've offered to cede the land in return for the stopping of violent attacks on their troops. We've decided to honor their peace offering and settle for just Southeastern Wyoming."
 tex.13.a:0 "All that for a piece of sand"
 tex.14.t:0 "Demands from the Republic of Texas"
 tex.14.d:0 "The small sliver of land in the Southwest of our country is being demanded by the Republic of Texas. Although it is a small sliver of land, to ceceed it would ruin our perfect borders. The perfectly rectangular shape of Kansas must not be ruined! In the name of Eisenhower, we will not give up our land to the Texan barbarians. It is not worth much, but we should make a statement against the Texans. We should stand against the Texans and their ambitions."
 tex.14.a:0 "Hand it over"
 tex.14.b:0 "Do not fold."
 tex.15.t:0 "The Kansans Have Denied Us!"
 tex.15.d:0 "Following our demands of Southwest Kansas, the Kansas high command has flatly declined our 'request'. They do not seem to be changing their minds any time soon. Our only course of action would be to attack them. Hopefull, we can keep this to a simple skirmish on the border and not escalate it further. If not, we may have to march all the way to West Kansas City before they give up."
 tex.15.a:0 "We will ruin their pathetic rectangle"
 tex.16.t:0 "A Texan Victory!"
 tex.16.d:0 "After many skirmishes on the Texan-Kansan border, the Texans have returned with news of victory. After many hours of rutheless fighting, the Kansan divisions surrendered, leaving Southwestern Kansas to us. The land may have little value, but the men in the land can be used successfully and the city enlatgened for people who would like to live in our glorious republic. This is a day to not be soon forgotten."
 tex.16.a:0 "A few more under our banner"
 tex.17.t:0 "The Old Republic of Texas Invites is to the Independent Republics of America"
 tex.17.d:0 "In an attempt to trifle with the plans of The New California Republic, The Old Texas Republic has invited us to their faction. They plan to create a coalition to stop the aggressive spread of California. With our help and many others, they may be able to achieve that goal. That only is if we do not want to align with the Californians. If we choose a side, there is a high probability that there will be war ahead of us, we just have to choose the winning side. Choosing incorrectly could spell the end of our nation."
 tex.17.a:0 "We're better off with them"
 tex.17.b:0 "We'd rather stay neutral for now"
 tex.18.t:0 "[From.GetName] has decided to remain neutral"
 tex.18.d:0 "Despite the current political climate, [From.GetName] has decided to remain neutral. It is unknown what will happen to them, but if they remain neutral for too long, they may be forced out of neutrality by the Californians. It is unknown where the Californians draw the line, but we do know that they will stop at nothing to get what they want. Nevada has suffered and lost their sovereignty to the Californians. Without us to back them up, who knows what will become of them. We can only hope that they do not get annexed in 'the name of the bear'"
 tex.18.a:0 "They will crumble alone."

#News Events
 texasnews.5.t:0 "The Capitol Building Under the Control of Nationalists!"
 texasnews.5.d:0 " \n A few hours ago, the Capitol Building in Austin was taken over by nationalists that have begun to fight for their cause. The army was swayed beneath our noses and now we must pay the price. Only time will tell what these nationalist want, but it doesn't look good. We fear what will happen to Texas if the nationalists take charge, but only time will tell. A government should not be so unnaware of what's happening beneath them, but hindsight is 20/20. We can only hope that Texas does not lose it's way."
 texasnews.5.a:0 "A glorious day for our cause!"
 texasnews.1.t:0 "The Republic of Texas Reaches Out!"
 texasnews.1.d:0 "James Allred has made a public statement calling out to all of the democratic countries that are willing to listen. James has stated that with the rising tension in the world, The Republic of Texas is planning to create a democratic coalition. If the coalition is sucessful, it could prove troublesome for aggressive ideologies. The hope of the coalition is to stop the spread of empires and keep their aggression in check. If they are sucessful, the coalition could mean the end of empires in North America all together. Whatever the outcome, let's hope it's good."
 texasnews.1.a:0 "We'll see how this develops."
 texasnews.2.t:0 "The Republic of Texas Denounces the New California Republic!"
 texasnews.2.d:0 "In a speech held by James Allred, he has denounced Californian ideals. He believes that they're not following true to democracy and they should reduce their aggression. Whether he will take action against California and her people is yet to be seen. The Californian high command has yet to respond publicly, but if relations sour, it could lead to horrible outcomes. We can only hope to restore stability and peace in the Americas. In time, we will see."
 texasnews.2.a:0 "And so it begins..."

 TXT_subversive_takeover_desc:0 "While the german sector of our ideology prides themselves on military might, we do not think like barbarians. We know the value of subversive activities and the wonders it can do for us. If we take our time with our governmental takeover, we can avoid countless months worth of reconstruction."
 TXT_promote_riots:0 "Encourage Riots"
 TXT_promote_riots_desc:0 "If the public is on our side, we are strong. Without the public we are nothing. If we can encourage people to riot in the large cities, lots of money will be spent on repression. Riots will also be a show of unwaivering loyalty to our cause, securing our hold and making our support look larger than it is."
 TXT_radio_broadcasts:0 "Begin Radio Broadcasts"
 TXT_radio_broadcasts_desc:0 "To increase the support of the public, we can start to broadcast radio programs. The radio is a powerful tool, and it could be the difference between the life or death of this cause. The radio is crucial to getting our cause out there and being seen by the public, which will hopefully increase our support."
 TXT_gain_support_of_generals:0 "Support from High Command"
 TXT_gain_support_of_generals_desc:0 "The generals in the country hold the power. With the support of the generals, a revolt would be strongly in our favor. The generals might be hard to sway, but with enough coaxing they may switch their allegiance. After all, they support the will of the people."
 TXT_gain_support_of_the_army:0 "Gain Support of the Army"
 TXT_gain_support_of_the_army_desc:0 "Without the support of the army, the generals will be of no use. We need the army to be in our favor to get a peaceful takeover. We can promise more military spending once in power, but we may not hold true to our word. That would not be a great idea, but we'll do what we have to."
 TXT_storm_the_capitol:0 "Storm the Capitol Building"
 TXT_storm_the_capitol_desc:0 "With support from all ground forces, we can now storm the Capitol Building in Austin. Those who opposed the new regime were quick to walk out after seeing how outnumbered they were. They will be missed in the army, but if there is a need, they will be forced back into the military. The Capitol Building will be ours, and the government will fall into a new light."
 TXT_rebuild_the_capitol:0 "Rebuild the Capitol"
 TXT_rebuild_the_capitol_desc:0 "While the march on the Capitol Building was a success, there were damages on the building and its surrounding areas. We did achieve our goal, though. If the march on the capital was a projection of our future sucess, then we will prosper. Civil war was avoided and it's better to repair just the capital and surrounding areas than to rebuild a whole nation."
 TXT_weaker_neighbors:0 "Subjugate the Weaker Neighbors"
 TXT_weaker_neighbors_desc:0 "While there are some ex-united states in North America that would be strong allies, the potential with them is limited. It would be a smarter idea to subjugate our smaller neighbors. While weak now, their potential is much higher in the hands of a capable government. Their governments will still exist, but they will merely be puppets to ours."
 TXT_diplomacy:0 "Texan Diplomacy"
 TXT_diplomacy_desc:0 "With our less radical government, we can promote Texan Diplomacy. We will reach out to all of our neighbors and attempt to make positive relations with them. If we succeed, we will have less of an annoyance when carrying out our plans. Even if our relations eventually sour, we now will have more time and more leverage for when we do begin to achieve our goals."
 TXT_influence:0 "Influence Foreign Governments"
 TXT_influence:0 "While the governments in America are steel reeling from the Great Collapse, we can try to sway them. Many countries in old United States have not set up a strong government yet, leaving exploitable areas within. We can try to send spies within their governments to try and convince officials of other political standings. Democracy has failed us, and we should treat it as such."
 TXT_naxis:0 "North American Axis"
 TXT_naxis_desc:0 "In North America, there has yet to be a strong country to lead others into the future. The failure of democracy and the rise of fascism in our country has left us to do the job. With seemingly nobody else to fill the power void in the South, we must step in and lead others to a future that we control. They will think the power is shared, but we know otherwise."

 TXT_arms_in_new_mexico_desc:0 "Arizona and California are very real threats and after their military defeat, New Mexico must get stronger.

 TXT_amentities_in_new_mexico_desc:0 "While the instructions were very clear on to avoid damaging civilian industry when moving through New Mexico was very clear, things did not go as planned. Civilian industry was still damaged, and it requires repair. Sometimes these things do not go as planned, but we just have to deal with them as they arise."
 TXT_santa_fe_austin_railway:0 "Austin-Santa Fe Railway"
 TXT_santa_fe_austin_railway_desc:0 "In the event of an Arizonan or Californian attack on New Mexico, we must be able to act quickly. A railway from Austin to Santa Fe will greatly increase our mobilization speed and allow us to move supplies much faster. It will also encourage industry in the areas that were less accessable before the railway."
 TXT_to_tulsa:0 "A March to Tulsa"
 TXT_to_tulsa_desc:0 "To secure our northern border from the ever-increasing aggression from Kansas, we must take preemptive action. The safest way to do this is to deprive Kansas of the Red River, an important strategic barrier between our nations. With their underside exposed, we will be able to march across their vast plains and into their capital or set up border defenses that will be inpenetrable by Kansan forces."
 TXT_arms_in_oklahoma:0 "Oklahoman Arms Investments"
 TXT_arms_in_oklahoma_desc:0 "While we could single-handedly defend against the Kansans if war were to break out, we could always do with a little more help. If we invest in the arms industry in Oklahoma, we could make more preparations. They could be a defensive force so we could be purely offensive. The arms industry in Oklahoma is needed to create a safe barrier between us and the Kansans."
 TXT_amentities_in_oklahoma:0 "Aid to the North"
 TXT_amentities_in_oklahoma_desc:0 "While the arms industry is important in Oklahoma, we are keeping them afloat. We must first need to construct civilian industry so that they can keep their own economy going. With the strain relieved, we could focus more on the military or increase our own civilian industry more. To create a viable state, the Oklahoman civilian industry is invaluable to creating strong puppet governments, making us stronger along the way."

 TXT_OK_city_austin_desc:0 "To properly mobilize our troops, we need an effective form of transport throughout our lands and our puppet's land.

 TXT_to_baton_rouge_desc:0 "For years we've been antagonized by the Louisianans. With the protection of the United States gone, the Louisianans will not have the last laugh.

We will march on Baton Rouge and show the Louisianans that without protection, they are able to be crushed and they will be."

 TXT_arms_in_louisiana_desc:0 "While the Louisianans did get taken over and occupied, the still hold a strong resentment towards us.

Now, we need to focus heavily on promoting a strong arms industry that will provide us with guns that will support us in times of war and create more for us to use in training."
 TXT_amentities_in_louisiana:0 "Aid to the East"
 TXT_amentities_in_louisiana_desc:0 "While the Louisianan people have a very strong distain for us, that doesn't mean they can't have basic human items. Unlike our radical counterparts, we do not support oppression and genocide. Our people's do not get along well, but in essence, we're all southerners, and we must stick together."
 TXT_baton_rouge_to_austin:0 "The Cajun Express"
 TXT_baton_rouge_to_austin_desc:0 "The terrain in Louisiana is some of the most hazardous in the country. Naturally this means that without proper infrastructure, our military will be functionally unable to perform their duties. A joint infrastructure modernization campaign with Louisiana will surely serve both of our interests."
 TXT_theoldrepublic:0 "The Old Republic"
 TXT_theoldrepublic_desc:0 "In the aftershock of the Great Collapse, the people are beginning to lose faith in democracy. Some are spreading propaganda blaming the whole thing of democracy. To make sure that the flame does not die out, we must restore our old republic. With the old republic of Texas, the citizens may begin to believe in democracy again."
 TXT_democratic_coalition:0 "A Democratic Coalition"
 TXT_democratic_coalition_desc:0 "What California plans to do with their democracy is preposterous. What they plan is not democracy in the slightest, they want to build an empire! They claim to be the true successor to the United States of America, yet they aggressively invade when denied. They throw fits like children! We need to be a true democracy. We will defeat the bear and their false democracy."
 TXT_aid_for_eastNM:0 "Protection for East New Mexico"
 TXT_aid_for_eastNM_desc:0 "In our efforts to restore the old republic, we need to gain control of previous Texan territory. While they are not loyal to Texas, the New Mexican border is the largest piece of land that we need to secure. To gain this land will be difficult, but the New Mexican government may be able to be negotiated with."
 TXT_demand_southwest_kansas:0 "Demand Southwest Kansas"
 TXT_demand_southwest_kansas_desc:0 "The smallest piece of missing territory is in Southern Kansas. It's not worth much, so the Kansan government may be willing to hand it over.

 TXT_aid_for_panhandle:0 "Aid for the Panhandle"
 TXT_aid_for_panhandle_desc:0 "Although the panhandle is Oklahoma's defining feature, we need it to proclaim our republic. It may have been ours first, but they own it now, and if we want it back, we will be benevolent. We will propose an offer of factories in return for the panhandle. Hopefully, the Oklahoman governent will be able to see reason. If not, they may have to be forced."
 TXT_aid_for_centralCO:0 "Protection for Central Colorado"
 TXT_aid_for_centralCO_desc:0 "Central Colorado is another large piece of land that we must reaquire for the Republic. While we are trying to gain land diplomatically, Kansas is not. With the threat of Kansas always looming over Colorado, we could offer protection from the barbarians. Hopefully, that will be enough to convince the Coloradans to split their land and give us the center."
 TXT_demand_southeast_wyoming:0 "Demand Southeast Wyoming"
 TXT_demand_southeast_wyoming_desc:0 "Southeast Wyoming has no economic value to anyone. It is held valuable to us by history. The small chunk of desert should not be hard to pry from Wyoming's hands. With their small population, they could never support a war with us, even a border skirmish could prove detremental to their economy. It seems impossible for them to refuse."
